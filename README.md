# CCT360 Portfolio Website
This is a portfolio website I created for my CCT360 Intermediate Web Design Course at Sheridan College.

This project is a portfolio website containing a videography section with some of my videos that were made 
by myself and uploaded to my YouTube channel, a photography section with my top 8 photos I have taken 
throughout my life using my Canon 1100D DSLR, an about me page which is self-explanatory, a contact me page 
which has my contact info, and lastly, an index page which is the home page for this portfolio website.

This portfolio website was made with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4.3.1 back in 2019 and it is one of my proudest
projects I have had the pleasure working on as I made it entirely from scratch using a text editor, except 
for the bootstrap part which was imported. Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy having a look at my 
portfolio website.
